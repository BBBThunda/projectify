    <h2>Developers</h2>

    <p>We are looking for help with general development, but here are some
    specific areas in which we could use some help:</p>

    <ul><li>Implementing Testing/CI</li>
        <li>Design/Layout/Front End</li>
        <li>Simple Graphic Design</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The code is available on
    <a href="https://github.com/BBBThunda/projectify">GitHub</a> with
    instructions that should help anyone get a test server running on your
    machine so you can play with the code and submit pull requests.</p>
